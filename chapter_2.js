/* Looping a Triangle 
Write a loop that makes seven calls to console.log to output the following triangle:

###
####
#####

/* FizzBuzz
Write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1 to 100, with two exceptions. For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), print "Buzz" instead. When you have that working, modify your program to print "FizzBuzz" for numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5 (and still print "Fizz" or "Buzz" for numbers divisible by only one of those).

/* Chessboard
Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8Ã—8 grid, using newline characters to separate lines. At each position of the grid there is either a space or a "#" character. The characters should form a chessboard. 

 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #

When you have a program that generates this pattern, define a binding size = 8 and change the program so that it works for any size, outputting a grid of the given width and height.
